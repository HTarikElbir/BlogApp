# BlogApp
Developed a blog application using EF Core and SQLite with a Code First approach and implemented the Repository pattern for better data management and separation of concerns. The system uses Claims-based authentication and authorization to manage user roles and access levels (e.g., admin). Admin users have the ability to view, edit, and update the status of their posts and comments, while regular users can create, edit, and comment on posts. The application supports real-time comment updates through AJAX requests, ensuring a dynamic user experience. Posts are tagged with specific labels, and users can click on these tags or a user's name to view the user's profile, showcasing the posts and comments they have published. This structure allows for efficient user management and smooth interaction with the content.
